# Backlog

Open work and known weak spots. Remove an entry in the commit that fixes it.

## Open questions for the user
- Close issue #2 (Hendrik: slippery look, different ground)? Both parts shipped on 2026-10-12.

## Tech debt
- `js/main.js` is ~510 lines, over the ~400 guideline. Split it when the next feature touches it: input, HUD and game state.
- Agent worktrees remain in `.claude/worktrees/` (ignored by git). They can be deleted.
- No browser test scripts in the repo. Screenshot checks used throwaway scripts. Add a small `tools/` script only if we keep needing it.

## Known limits (accepted)
- **Scores can be faked.** The client reports them. Fine among friends; see ADR 0006.
- **The leaderboard can lose updates** when two people submit within about 60 s (KV read-modify-write, eventual consistency).
- **Per-IP rate limits are per worker isolate**, so they are soft. The daily idea cap in KV is the real backstop.
- The wrangler cache file with the Cloudflare account id is in git history (`e217f0a`). It holds no secret.
- `index.html#debug` exposes `window.rollDown` in production. Harmless: it only gives access to a game you can already play.

## Not yet verified
- Never tested on a real phone (only headless Chrome at iPhone size). Check iOS Safari above all.
- On phones without a GPU canvas, a frame takes about 50–70 ms at 4x CPU throttling, measured in headless Chrome.

## Reminders
- The GitHub token needs an expiry date (e.g. 90 days) plus a calendar reminder to rotate it.
- Keep 2FA on for GitHub and Cloudflare.
